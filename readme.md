# 🍷 Wine Dataset Analysis

This project explores the classic Wine dataset, which contains the chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. It involves data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and modeling to classify wine types and understand feature importance.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The Wine dataset contains **178** samples of wine, each described by **13 numeric features**:

- Alcohol
- Malic acid
- Ash
- Alcalinity of ash
- Magnesium
- Total phenols
- Flavanoids
- Nonflavanoid phenols
- Proanthocyanins
- Color intensity
- Hue
- OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
- Proline

Each wine sample is classified into one of **3 classes (cultivars)**.
